flashing effect = malwux on discord (i made it do the flashing faster)
tunnel = i forgot but probably falsedata_ (i made it do the tunnel faster)
error icons = pact8 (i converted c++ to python)
"idk what gdi this is called" = pact8 (i converted c++ to python, made it shorter, edited values)
darkr = pankoza
text = falsedata_ (i made it have random colors)
bouncingcircle = pankoza (i made it faster)
ellipse = pankoza (i made it faster)
wide = pankoza

combined tunnel, flashing, error icons = me
combined "idk what gdi this is called", darkr = me
